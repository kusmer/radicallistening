                <p><b>Discover the transformative power of Radical Listening™—a practice that unveils collective wisdom by fostering a deep sense of interconnectedness and community.</b> Based on Dr. Kinari Webb’s pathbreaking work with <a href="https://healthinharmony.org">Health In Harmony</a>, an organization dedicated to environmental conservation and community health, this book explores a way of listening that honors a community's inherent wisdom and expertise, and supports entire ecosystems in thriving.

                        <b>Kinari Webb, M.D.</b> first developed the vision behind her conservation work in 1993, as an undergraduate studying orangutans in Indonesian Borneo. There, she encountered not only a beautiful and threatened natural environment, but also the dire health needs of its people. After earning her M.D. at Yale University School of Medicine, she founded Health In Harmony and co-founded the ASRI foundation in West Kalimantan, Borneo, to address these critical, interrelated issues. Dr. Webb has been honored as an Ashoka Social Entrepreneur and Rainier Arnhold Fellow, and is a two-time TEDx presenter. She has been interviewed by the BBC, NPR, NewsHour, O Magazine, The Lancet, Outdoor Magazine, Forbes, and Sierra Club, among many others. A compelling and entertaining speaker, Health In Harmony has raised over 20 million dollars for her work, including funds for a $2.2-million hospital in Indonesia. In 2021, Flatiron Books published her award-winning memoir, Guardians of the Trees: A Journey of Hope Through Healing the Planet. Kinari lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her partner and two young sons.</p></div>
